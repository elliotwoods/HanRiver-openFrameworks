#A. OpenNI-test

Test to view data from the kinect, and generate a point cloud using ofxOpenNI2 and ofxCVgui.

## ofxOpenNI2

Arturo is hosting his own ofxOpenNI version on github at
https://github.com/arturoc/ofxOpenNI2.git

We'll be using that version here

## Setting up OpenNI with kinect

There's plenty of identical sets of instructions for this on the internet.

Check http://kinecthesis.bakedmac.com/2011/01/11/installing-openni-kinect-drivers-and-nite-on-mac-os-x-10-6/ for 1 set

Note that OpenNI binaries for all platforms are available at

http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx

i.e. NOT the URL given in those instructions.
